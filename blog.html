                <p class="fw-normal">As you have heard or seen many influential people are being arrested and the question is are they promoting jails, have side businesses in jail , or may be we don&apos;t know what&apos;s popping they are giving out free s** guys(Johnny&amp; Mia)/ chocolates in jails or may be i&apos;m mistaken there are others reasons they competing to go there!</p>
                <img src="image/fata.jpg" width="400" height="100%">
                <p class="fw-normal">For the first time out of no where this guy called Fata kumavuta get arrested because of his stupid mouth and fingers which do not know what to type and speak in public and on social media and I don&apos;t quite believe this because there is no&nbsp; way one get arrested because of his stupid mouth but from what we get from RIB is that his charged of inciting division, using offensive language, and harassing individuals through social media platforms(Especially this guys The Ben and Meddy )<br>In light of this incident, Dr. Murangira urged social media users to utilize these platforms responsibly and in accordance with the law. &ldquo;The government invests significant resources in infrastructure to ensure access to fast internet, as it aims for social media to be a tool for positive engagement, free from criminal activities,&rdquo; he stated.<br>And I think me too i don&apos;t have any stupid comment left because I don&apos;t want my f*cking good hand cut off<img src="image/proxy-image.jpg" width="400"></p>
                <p class="fw-normal">Then after that as if that case of Fata kumavuta was not enough this girl then overnight drove her car and crush into houses.&quot; A beauty queen in Rwanda has been arrested for drink-driving and driving without a licence.
Police said Divine Muheto, who won the most recent Miss Rwanda beauty pageant, had damaged &quot;infrastructure&quot; and then fled the scene. The statement does not say whether anybody was hurt in the incident.
It is not the first time the 21-year-old has driven under the influence of alcohol, police in the East African country added.&quot; as we get it from bbc.com<br>Then what else are we duelling on I think this isn&apos;t real it&apos;s juust a plank! but spare I&apos;m just kidding I did mean nothing. I don&apos;t want to be put on RIB waiting list please!</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">Novemberr 1, 2024 by <a href="#">Chris</a></p>
                <p class="fw-normal">⚠First quick disclaimer the title above it&apos;s not my type to use those abusing names it&apos;s<br> up to Elon Musk who have said so in the interview because they have not yet decided name.<img src="image/BfR.jpg" width="800" height="100%"></p>
                <p class="fw-normal">How come did Elon musk decided to build big rocket like this? as Elon himself told <br>waitbutwhy.com(which I recommend you to use for top rated stories explained clearly) he wants to make the journey to Mars be real not dreams<br><b>Why Mars?</b><br> Venus is a stupid, with its lead-melting temperatures, its crushing atmospheric pressure, and its unbearable winds.<br> Same deal on Mercury.
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are just huge balls of gas pretending to be planets.
Certain moons of Jupiter and Saturn are possibly habitable, but they&rsquo;re farther away and colder and darker than Mars, so why would we do that.<br> Pluto is even farther and colder and darker. Stop asking me about Pluto.<br> That leaves Mars.<br> If Mars were a place on Earth, it&rsquo;s somewhere no one would want to go.It&rsquo;s cold but not that cold. It&rsquo;s kind of dark but not that much darker than Earth. It&rsquo;s far but not that far. Its day is almost the same length as ours, which is nice for us and hugely helpful for growing Earthly vegetation.<br> But going to Mars it is just that easy if you do not look in the window of finance or budget to go to the mars &quot;Last time the US Congress checked with NASA, the cost to send a five-person crew to Mars was $50 billion. $10 billion a person. Elon thinks that to make journey to Mars affordable, it needs to cost $500,000 a person. 1/20,000 of the current cost.<br>;&quot;That&rsquo;s like looking at the car industry and saying, &ldquo;Right now a new Honda costs around $20,000. To make this a viable industry, we need to get the cost of a new car down to $1.<br>So what the hell?<br><b>Here&rsquo;s the hell:</b>
                Imagine if the way planes worked was that they took off, flew to their destination, but then instead of landing, all the passengers parachuted down to the ground and then the plane landed by smashing into the ocean and blowing up. So every plane flew exactly once, and to have a new flight happen, you&rsquo;d have to build another plane.
                A plane ticket would cost $1.5 million.<br>  like in above comparison that why the tripss in space are expensive because rockecks after the trip are crushed into oceans&nbsp; and this the challenge Elon Musk come to beat given that no one who have tried it beforeand that&apos;s how we come to have this big rocket which is reusable like today&apos;s planes and this at some percentage will make the journey to the mars with smart rockets to do more than one journey.<br> That leaves us with somewhere between 19/20 and 199/200 of the cost left to cut. Part of that will happen when SpaceX takes 100 or more people to Mars at a time, instead of five (the number Congress asked NASA about). The rest of it is taken care of by a few simple innovations, like refueling the spaceships in orbit (which lowers the cost by 5-10x) and manufacturing propellant on Mars so you don&rsquo;t have to carry your return propellant with you (which lowers the cost by another 5-10x).

    <h3>Part 1: The "Oh God, Why Didn't I Know About This Before?" Tools</h3>

    <p class="fw-normal">1. <b>Notion (AKA Your Second Brain)</b><br>
    Remember that time you had 47 different notes scattered across your phone, laptop, and that mysterious piece of paper that vanished into the void? Notion is like having Marie Kondo organize your brain, except it's digital and doesn't make you thank your old notes before deleting them.</p>

    <p class="fw-normal">2. <b>Zotero (The Citation Wizard)</b><br>
    If you've ever spent 3 hours trying to format citations correctly, only to end up crying into your APA manual, this one's for you. Zotero is like having a really nerdy friend who actually enjoys doing citations.</p>

    <h3>Part 2: The "Time Management" Revolution</h3>

    <p class="fw-normal">3. <b>Forest App</b><br>
    Here's the deal: you plant a virtual tree, and if you pick up your phone while studying, your tree dies. It's basically guilt-tripping you into productivity, and honestly? It works disturbingly well.</p>

    <p class="fw-normal">4. <b>Obsidian (For When Your Brain Goes "404 Not Found")</b><br>
    Think of it as building your personal Wikipedia, except it's actually accurate and doesn't have that one guy arguing about conspiracy theories in the comments.</p>

    <h3>Part 3: The "AI Companions That Won't Take Over The World" Section</h3>

    <p class="fw-normal">5. <b>Claude AI (That's me! *waves awkwardly*)</b><br>
    For when you need help:
    - Brainstorming ideas
    - Understanding complex concepts
    - Pretending you know what "epistemology" means</p>

    <p class="fw-normal">6. <b>Grammarly</b><br>
    Because let's face it, sometimes your writing looks like you let a caffeinated squirrel loose on your keyboard.</p>

    <h3>The Reality Check Section:</h3>

    <p class="fw-normal">Here's the thing - these tools are great, but they're not magical "make me smart" buttons (unfortunately, those are still in development). They're more like having a really efficient personal assistant who doesn't judge you for sending emails at 3 AM.</p>

    <h3>Action Steps (Because Every Blog Post Needs Them):</h3>

    <p class="fw-normal">
    1. Pick ONE tool to start with (preferably while procrastinating on something else)<br>
    2. Actually use it for more than 2 days<br>
    3. Resist the urge to go back to your "system" of 147 sticky notes<br>
    4. Repeat until you feel like a functional student</p>

    <p class="fw-normal"><i>P.S. If you're still reading this instead of working on that assignment that's due tomorrow, maybe start with the Forest app. Just saying.</i></p>
